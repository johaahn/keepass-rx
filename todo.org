now:
 - fix lockup (async?)
 - load images (or at least always show placeholder)
 - easy unlock (encrypt db password into file using user password)
 - not visible icon
 - settings do not get persisted (which also causes the issue w/ the missing db on start)
 - instead of full path, print only the filename when it's been picked from contentpicker.

later:
 - gpl compliance
 - ci pipeline
